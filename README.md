# HTML-CSS-JS-Projects

Welcome to my repository showcasing a collection of personal projects as I delve into the world of web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This repository serves as a space where I document my learning journey, experiment with various concepts, and build small applications and websites.

## About
In this repository, you'll find a range of projects that reflect my ongoing learning process. These projects are aimed at practicing and implementing different aspects of front-end web development. Each project might vary in complexity and may focus on specific aspects such as responsive design, CSS animations, JavaScript interactivity, etc.

Each project folder contains the necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files along with a README providing details about the project, the concepts applied, and sometimes a live demo or screenshots.
